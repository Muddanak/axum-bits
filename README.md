# Axum bits and pieces (Also a WIP)

## Basic implementations for anyone to view to get started with Axum

Feel free to use this as a getting-started guide for a quick setup for Axum.  I wouldn't exactly call this an Axum tutorial, just more a demo of using it.  I'll add more in time.

### The starting point is the aptly named [start](https://github.com/Muddanak/axum-bits/tree/master/basics/start)

Then you can look at either [responders](https://github.com/Muddanak/axum-bits/tree/master/basics/responders) or [extractors](https://github.com/Muddanak/axum-bits/tree/master/basics/extractors)
